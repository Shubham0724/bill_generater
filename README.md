Problem solution:-
Suppose you have a template letter.txt. You have to fill in values to a template. Letter.txt looks something like this:

Thanks {{name}} for purchasing {{item}} from our outlet {{outlet}}. Please visit our outlet {{outlet}} for any kind of problems. We plan to serve you again soon.

You have to write a program that will automatically fill the template.For this, read this file and replace these values:

{{name}} - shubham 

{{item}} - Nike OG shoe 

{{outlet}} - Nike store

Use file functions in c to accomplish the same.
